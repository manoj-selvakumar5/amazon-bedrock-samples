    "#### Notebook Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores building a Q&A application using Bedrock Knowledgebase RetrieveAndGenerate API with a reranker model. We'll compare results with and without reranking, and evaluate responses using metrics including faithfulness, relevancy, recall, precision, and correctness.\n",

For instance, PersonC, our Treasurer, mentioned that during the COVID-19 pandemic, the market for commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) became illiquid, making it challenging to sell these securities at fair market values.     ### Operational Risk     Octank Financial is exposed to operational risk due to the possibility of losses resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems, or from external events. Our risk management policies and procedures aim to minimize this risk, but we cannot eliminate it entirely. For example, we have experienced cyber-attacks in the past, which resulted in the loss of sensitive data and financial losses.     ### Regulatory RiskOctank Financial is exposed to regulatory risk due to the possibility of changes in laws and regulations that affect our business. These changes could result in additional compliance costs, restrictions on our activities, or penalties for non-compliance. We monitor regulatory developments and engage with policymakers to minimize the impact of these changes, but we cannot eliminate this risk entirely.     ### Strategic Risk     Octank Financial is exposed to strategic risk due to the possibility that our strategies may not achieve their intended results or that we may not be able to adapt to changes in the market or regulatory environment. Our strategic planning processes aim to minimize this risk, but we cannot eliminate it entirely.'},\n",
