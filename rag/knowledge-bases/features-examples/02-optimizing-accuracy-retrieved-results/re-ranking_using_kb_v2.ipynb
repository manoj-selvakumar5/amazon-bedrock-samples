    "# Re-ranking\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon Bedrock provides access to reranker models that you can use when querying to improve the relevance of the retrieved results.  reranker model calculates the relevance of chunks to a query and reorders the results based on the scores that it calculates. By using a reranker model, you can return responses that are better suited to answering the query. \n",
    "\n",
    "Reranker models are trained to identify relevance signals based on a query and then use those signals to rank documents. Because of this, the models can provide more relevant, more accurate results.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're using `Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases` for building your Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) application, use a reranker model while calling the `Retrieve` or `RetrieveAndGenerate operation`. The results from reranking override the default ranking that Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases determines.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the use of **reranking model** with Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases, through the Rerank API which will help to further improve the accuracy and relevance of RAG applications. With a reranker model, you can retrieve fewer, but more relevant, results. By feeding these results to the foundation model that you use to generate a response, you can also decrease cost and latency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore how to implement and utilize reranking models with Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases for an example use case."

    "#     \"One of the most significant lessons from Amazon's early retail model that influenced the development of AWS was a relentless focus on customer needs and value. From the beginning, Amazon aimed to provide compelling value to customers through features like vast selection, easy-to-use interfaces, low prices, and fast delivery. This customer-centricity translated into AWS, where the focus shifted from offering monolithic solutions to developing a set of flexible and granular services (primitives) that catered to the diverse needs of developers and businesses. This approach allowed AWS to adapt to the specific requirements of its users, fostering rapid innovation and adoption. By prioritizing customer needs and delivering tailored solutions, AWS mirrored the core philosophy that drove Amazon's success in the retail space.\",\n",
    "#     \"From 2019 to 2021, Amazon made significant strides in its sustainability journey. Key achievements included co-founding The Climate Pledge, committing to net-zero carbon by 2040, and becoming the world's largest corporate buyer of renewable energy. They made progress towards their ambitious renewable energy targets and expanded their renewable energy infrastructure with numerous wind and solar projects globally. In addition to these milestones, Amazon continued its Frustration-Free Packaging program, promoting recyclable packaging and reducing waste. These efforts demonstrate Amazon's dedication to sustainable practices and minimizing its environmental impact.\",\n",
    "#     \"Amazon reported an operating income of $36.9 billion in 2023. This represents a substantial improvement, marking a 201% increase from their 2022 operating income of $12.2 billion.\",\n",
    "#     \"Amazon has made a smart move by developing its own chips for cloud computing. Their main chips - Graviton, Trainium, and Inferentia - are giving them a real edge in the market. These aren't just regular chips; they're specially designed to work better and cost less than what's typically available. The numbers really show why this matters. For example, their Graviton2 chip performs 40% better for the price compared to traditional x86 processors. Even more impressive is their Trainium chip, which can handle machine learning tasks 140% faster while cutting costs by 70%. This kind of performance is attracting big names in AI, like Anthropic, to use AWS. What's also clever about this strategy is that by making their own chips, Amazon doesn't have to rely on other companies for supply. This means they can keep their prices competitive and offer better deals to their customers in the long run. It's really helping them stay ahead in the cloud computing business, which keeps getting more competitive every year.\",\n",
    "#     \"In 2022, Amazon's infrastructure investments showed a clear focus on adapting to economic challenges while positioning for long-term growth. The company prioritized streamlining costs and improving efficiency in its fulfillment and transportation networks, redesigning processes to lower costs and speed up deliveries. In AWS, Amazon doubled down on innovation, investing heavily in proprietary technologies like Graviton3 and Inferentia2 chips to enhance performance and cost savings for customers, strengthening its competitive edge in the cloud market. Additionally, Amazon diversified its investments into emerging areas like Amazon Business, Healthcare, and the Kuiper satellite program, signaling a commitment to exploring new growth opportunities.\",\n",
    "#     \"Amazon achieved an impressive 12% net sales growth in 2023, driven by strategic initiatives and favorable market conditions. A key factor was the expansion of its product selection, supported by its thriving third-party seller ecosystem. This was paired with significant investments in customer experience, particularly in speeding up delivery times, resulting in record-breaking same-day and next-day deliveries. The company also benefited from the strong performance of its advertising business and continued growth in subscription services like Amazon Prime. Despite ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties, the minimal impact of foreign exchange fluctuations in 2023 highlights the strength of these growth drivers in overcoming external challenges.\"\n",

    "    \"Amazon's 2023 net sales mix highlights its global priorities, with North America contributing 61%, International 23%, and AWS 16% of total sales. Year-over-year growth in each segment—12% for North America, 11% for International, and 13% for AWS—was driven by increased unit sales, advertising services, and subscription offerings. These trends reflect Amazon's balanced approach to expanding its core markets, strengthening its international presence, and investing in AWS's innovative cloud services to sustain long-term growth.\",\n",
    "    \"In 2023, foreign exchange rate fluctuations had a mixed impact on Amazon's financial performance.

Together, these segments contributed significantly to Amazon's total consolidated revenue of $434 billion. AWS accounted for 19.59%, while Advertising contributed 7.14%, resulting in a cumulative contribution of approximately 26.73%.\",\n",
    "    \"In 2022, Amazon's substantial investments in technology infrastructure and fulfillment operations significantly impacted its cash flows and operating expenses. The company allocated $58.3 billion in cash capital expenditures to support AWS growth and expand its fulfillment network, resulting in a 31% increase in technology and content expenses due to higher payroll costs for technical teams and infrastructure spending on servers, networking equipment, and data centers. Fulfillment costs rose by 12%, driven by increased product sales volume, inventory levels, and wage rate incentives. These investments led to a decline in free cash flow to $(11,569) million, compared to $(9,069) million in 2021. Despite the higher costs, these expenditures were crucial for scaling operations, enhancing the customer experience, and sustaining long-term growth, particularly in AWS and global fulfillment capacity, highlighting Amazon’s commitment to maintaining its competitive edge in a rapidly evolving market.\",\n",
    "    \"Amazon typically invests its excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment-grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities, which are classified as either Cash and cash equivalents or Marketable securities on its consolidated balance sheets. In 2019, Amazon's marketable securities portfolio included a variety of assets such as money market funds, equity securities, foreign government and agency securities, U.S. government and agency securities, corporate debt securities, asset-backed securities, and other fixed income securities. These marketable securities were categorized as either Level 1 or Level 2 securities on the balance sheet.\",\n",
    "    \"From 2019 to 2023, Amazon significantly enhanced delivery speeds by adopting a regionalized fulfillment network, reducing transportation distances and improving inventory placement accuracy. The company expanded its same-day and next-day delivery infrastructure, achieving record speeds with over 7 billion items delivered in 2023, supported by advanced machine learning for demand forecasting and inventory optimization. Investments in fulfillment centers, delivery stations, and Amazon Air further streamlined operations, while a customer-centric approach solidified fast delivery as a key feature of Amazon Prime, driving customer satisfaction and loyalty.\",\n",
    "    \"Amazon's investment in green energy, including large-scale wind and solar projects, has significantly enhanced operational efficiency by reducing energy costs and supporting its commitment to sustainability. By achieving 100% renewable energy usage five years ahead of its original 2030 target, Amazon has lowered its carbon footprint and energy expenses across its operations, particularly in energy-intensive areas like AWS data centers. These efforts align with The Climate Pledge and demonstrate how sustainability initiatives can simultaneously drive cost savings and long-term resilience. \"\n",

In 2023, Amazon delivered more than 7 billion items to Prime members at the fastest speeds ever, including over 4 billion in the U.S. and over 2 billion in Europe. This was achieved through two key efforts: 1) Regionalization, where Amazon re-architected its network to store items closer to customers, and 2) Expansion of same-day delivery facilities, which increased the number of items delivered same-day or overnight by nearly 70% year-over-year in 2023.

In 2023, Amazon delivered more than 7 billion items to Prime members at same-day or next-day speeds, including over 4 billion in the U.S. and over 2 billion in Europe. This represents a major increase in delivery speed compared to previous years. The search results attribute this improvement in delivery speeds to two key factors. First, Amazon has re-architected its fulfillment network to store items closer to customers, a process called \"regionalization\". Second, Amazon has expanded its same-day delivery facilities, increasing the number of items delivered same-day or overnight by nearly 70% year-over-year in 2023.\n",

This sales mix reflects Amazon's strategic priorities and investments across its key business segments: - The North America segment, which includes Amazon's online and physical stores in the US and Canada, remains Amazon's largest and most important market, accounting for the majority of net sales. This indicates that Amazon continues to prioritize and invest heavily in its core retail business in North America. - The International segment, which includes Amazon's online and physical stores outside of North America, accounts for a smaller but still significant portion of net sales at 23%. This suggests that while Amazon continues to expand globally, its international operations are not yet as large or as profitable as its North American business. - AWS, Amazon's cloud computing and web services business, accounts for 16% of net sales. This indicates that while AWS is a rapidly growing and highly profitable part of Amazon's business, it is still smaller than the company's core retail operations in terms of net sales.\",\n",

In 2023, Amazon delivered more than 7 billion items to Prime members at the fastest speeds ever, including over 4 billion in the U.S. and over 2 billion in Europe. This was achieved through two key efforts: 1) Regionalization, where Amazon re-architected its network to store items closer to customers, and 2) Expansion of same-day delivery facilities, which increased the number of items delivered same-day or overnight by nearly 70% year-over-year in 2023. These improvements have allowed Amazon to reduce its cost to serve per unit, which in turn has enabled the company to invest in faster delivery speeds and add more selection at lower prices.   \n",

In 2023, Amazon delivered more than 7 billion items to Prime members at same-day or next-day speeds, including over 4 billion in the U.S. and over 2 billion in Europe. This represents a major increase in delivery speed compared to previous years. The search results attribute this improvement in delivery speeds to two key factors. First, Amazon has re-architected its fulfillment network to store items closer to customers, a process called \"regionalization\". Second, Amazon has expanded its same-day delivery facilities, increasing the number of items delivered same-day or overnight by nearly 70% year-over-year in 2023.   \n",

According to the search results, Amazon's infrastructure is 3.6 times more energy efficient than the median U.S. enterprise data center, and the company's use of renewable energy has enabled it to achieve an 88% lower carbon footprint compared to traditional data centers. Additionally, Amazon has made significant investments in renewable energy projects, including 62 utility-scale wind and solar projects and 125 solar rooftops on its fulfillment and sort centers globally. These projects have the capacity to generate over 6.9 gigawatts and deliver more than 20 million megawatt-hours of energy annually, which helps power Amazon's operations in a more sustainable way.   \n",

Fulfillment costs rose by 12%, driven by increased product sales volume, inventory levels, and wage rate incentives. These investments led to a decline in free cash flow to $(11,569) million, compared to $(9,069) million in 2021. Despite the higher costs, these expenditures were crucial for scaling operations, enhancing the customer experience, and sustaining long-term growth, particularly in AWS and global fulfillment capacity, highlighting Amazon’s commitment to maintaining its competitive edge in a rapidly evolving market.\"\n",
