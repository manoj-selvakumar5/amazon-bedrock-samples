    "# Re-ranking\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon Bedrock provides access to reranker models that you can use when querying to improve the relevance of the retrieved results.  reranker model calculates the relevance of chunks to a query and reorders the results based on the scores that it calculates. By using a reranker model, you can return responses that are better suited to answering the query. \n",
    "\n",
    "Reranker models are trained to identify relevance signals based on a query and then use those signals to rank documents. Because of this, the models can provide more relevant, more accurate results.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're using `Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases` for building your Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) application, use a reranker model while calling the `Retrieve` or `RetrieveAndGenerate operation`. The results from reranking override the default ranking that Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases determines.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the use of **reranking model** with Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases, through the Rerank API which will help to further improve the accuracy and relevance of RAG applications. With a reranker model, you can retrieve fewer, but more relevant, results. By feeding these results to the foundation model that you use to generate a response, you can also decrease cost and latency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore how to implement and utilize reranking models with Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases for an example use case."

       "- A N N U A L R E P O R T     2 0 2 3Dear Shareholders:     Last year at this time, I shared my enthusiasm and optimism for Amazon’s future. Today, I have even more. The reasons are many, but start with the progress we’ve made in our financial results and customer experiences, and extend to our continued innovation and the remarkable opportunities in front of us.     In 2023, Amazon’s total revenue grew 12% year-over-year (“YoY”) from $514B to $575B. By segment, North America revenue increased 12% YoY from $316B to $353B, International revenue grew 11% YoY from $118B to $131B, and AWS revenue increased 13% YoY from $80B to $91B.     Further, Amazon’s operating income and Free Cash Flow (“FCF”) dramatically improved. Operating income in 2023 improved 201% YoY from $12.2B (an operating margin of 2.4%) to $36.9B (an operating margin of 6.4%). Trailing Twelve Month FCF adjusted for equipment finance leases improved from -$12.8B in 2022 to $35.5B (up $48.3B).     While we’ve made meaningful progress on our financial measures, what we’re most pleased about is the continued customer experience improvements across our businesses.\n",

      "\n",
      "- The search results indicate that Amazon's advertising business is growing rapidly, with 24% year-over-year growth from 2022 to 2023, primarily driven by sponsored ads. This suggests the advertising model has significant room for continued expansion. - Amazon is expanding its advertising offerings into new areas like streaming TV, where it can reach over 200 million monthly viewers across Prime Video, Freevee, and Twitch. This ability to leverage its large customer base and integrate advertising across its various platforms indicates the scalability of the advertising model. - In contrast, the search results suggest that Amazon's AWS segment, while still having significant growth potential, is currently focused on helping customers optimize their cloud usage and leverage more cost-effective AWS capabilities. This implies the AWS segment may face more constraints on scalability in the near term compared to the advertising business.\n",

By transitioning to a regionalized network, Amazon was able to optimize inventory placement and logistics, allowing each region to be largely self-sufficient and reducing the need for long-distance shipping. This change has helped Amazon improve the efficiency and carbon footprint of its operations.\n",

      "[Response] : Project Kuiper is a significant growth opportunity for Amazon for several reasons: 1) It aims to provide high-quality broadband internet access to hundreds of millions of households and businesses around the world that currently lack reliable internet connectivity. This represents a large potential customer base that could benefit from Kuiper's services. 2) Kuiper is capital-intensive upfront, but has significant revenue and profit potential, similar to Amazon's AWS business. It also requires technical and inventive capabilities that few other companies possess, giving Amazon a potential competitive advantage.\n",

Specifically: - In its Stores business, Amazon has continued to expand its product selection, improve pricing, and enhance delivery speeds, which has led to increased customer demand and revenue growth. In 2023, Amazon delivered more than 7 billion items to Prime members at its fastest speeds ever. (Source 2)\n",

      "[Response] : Amazon's advertising model appears to have strong scalability compared to its traditional retail and AWS segments. The search results indicate that Amazon's advertising business, which includes sponsored ads, display, and video advertising, is growing quickly and is a significant part of the company's overall revenue. Specifically, the results note that Amazon's advertising revenue grew 24% year-over-year from 2022 to 2023, driven primarily by its sponsored ads offerings. This suggests that Amazon's advertising model can scale effectively to generate increasing revenue. In contrast, the search results do not provide as much information about the scalability of Amazon's traditional retail and AWS segments. The retail segment is described as serving consumers through online and physical stores, while AWS is described as offering a broad set of on-demand technology services. However, the search results do not directly compare the scalability of these segments to the advertising business. Overall, the information provided suggests that Amazon's advertising model may have greater scalability potential compared to its other business segments.\n",

This iterative innovation helps Amazon adapt to changing economic conditions. 2) The 'Day 1' philosophy emphasizes that Amazon should never let itself become complacent or 'smooth[ed] into its surroundings'.

(Source 1, Source 2)\\n2) It allows Amazon to be agile and adapt quickly to changing market conditions and competitive threats. Rather than trying to \"fight gravity\" and resist new technologies, Amazon embraces them if they enable better customer experiences. (Source 3)\\n3) It fosters a culture of experimentation and learning from failures. Amazon is willing to try new ideas and accept that some may not work, using that knowledge to try again with new approaches. This helps the company stay resilient in the face of challenges.

       "21  According to the search results, Amazon faced trade-offs when balancing long-term investments in AWS with short-term profitability pressures. During the 2008-2009 recession, Amazon had to take actions to manage the cost structure and efficiency of its retail business, but it also continued to invest heavily in AWS, which was still a relatively small and fledgling business at the time. Despite voices questioning why Amazon was investing so much in cloud computing, the company knew it was \"inventing something special that could create a lot of value for customers and Amazon in the future.\" Amazon made the long-term decision to accelerate its pace of innovation in AWS, even as it faced short-term headwinds. More recently, the search results indicate that AWS continues to face short-term headwinds as companies are being more cautious in their spending due to challenging macroeconomic conditions. However, Amazon remains confident in its plans to lower costs, reduce delivery times, and b...   \n",

First, Amazon has invested in 86 solar and wind projects globally that have the capacity to generate over 2,300 MW of renewable energy annually, enough to power more than 580,000 U.S. homes. This renewable energy helps power Amazon's operations with a lower carbon footprint. Additionally, Amazon has made its data centers more energy efficient by using more efficient evaporative cooling instead of traditional air conditioning, which a study found makes Amazon's infrastructure 3.6 times more energy efficient than the median U.S. enterprise data center.   \n",

The search results indicate that the previous national fulfillment network required shipping products from other parts of the country, which increased delivery times and costs. By transitioning to a regionalized network, Amazon was able to optimize inventory placement and logistics, allowing each region to be largely self-sufficient and reducing the need for long-distance shipping. This change has helped Amazon improve the efficiency and carbon footprint of its operations.   \n",

By delivering affordable and accessible internet, Kuiper could enable people to access online education, financial services, start businesses, shop, and enjoy entertainment, while also allowing businesses and governments to improve their operations and efficiency. Amazon believes Kuiper shares similarities with AWS in that it is capital-intensive upfront but has the potential for significant revenue and operating profit in the long run, as well as a large prospective customer base that few other companies have the technical and inventive capabilities to go after. The positive customer reaction to Kuiper so far suggests it represents a very large opportunity for Amazon.   \n",

AWS's infrastructure is 3.6 times more energy efficient than the median U.S. enterprise data center, and its operations have an 88% lower carbon footprint. (Source 3) Second, Amazon has made significant investments in renewable energy projects to power AWS and work towards making it 100% carbon-free. The company is committed to driving its carbon footprint to zero despite the fact that online shopping is already more carbon efficient than in-person shopping. (Source 1, Source 3)   \n",
       "36                              According to the search results, Amazon has taken several steps to address corporate social responsibility (CSR) in recent years. In 2021, Amazon co-founded The Climate Pledge, committing to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement 10 years early and achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2040. As part of this pledge, Amazon plans to purchase 100,000 electric delivery vans from Rivian, with 10,000 on the road as early as 2022 and all 100,000 by 2030. The search results do not provide detailed information on the evolution of Amazon's approach to CSR over the years. However, the 2022 shareholder letter indicates that Amazon has faced \"operating challenges\" and made \"important adjustments in [its] investment decisions\" while still preserving long-term investments that can \"change the future of Amazon for customers, shareholders, and employees.\" This suggests that Amazon's CSR efforts may have evolved over time to address changing business conditions and priorities.   \n",
