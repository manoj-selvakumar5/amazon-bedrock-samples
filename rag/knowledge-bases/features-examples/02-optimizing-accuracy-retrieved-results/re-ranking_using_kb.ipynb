    "# Re-ranking\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon Bedrock provides access to reranker models that you can use when querying to improve the relevance of the retrieved results.  reranker model calculates the relevance of chunks to a query and reorders the results based on the scores that it calculates. By using a reranker model, you can return responses that are better suited to answering the query. \n",
    "\n",
    "Reranker models are trained to identify relevance signals based on a query and then use those signals to rank documents. Because of this, the models can provide more relevant, more accurate results.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're using `Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases` for building your Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) application, use a reranker model while calling the `Retrieve` or `RetrieveAndGenerate operation`. The results from reranking override the default ranking that Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases determines.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the use of **reranking model** with Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases, through the Rerank API which will help to further improve the accuracy and relevance of RAG applications. With a reranker model, you can retrieve fewer, but more relevant, results. By feeding these results to the foundation model that you use to generate a response, you can also decrease cost and latency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore how to implement and utilize reranking models with Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases for an example use case."

    "    \"Amazon's 2023 net sales mix highlights its global priorities, with North America contributing 61%, International 23%, and AWS 16% of total sales. Year-over-year growth in each segment—12% for North America, 11% for International, and 13% for AWS—was driven by increased unit sales, advertising services, and subscription offerings. These trends reflect Amazon's balanced approach to expanding its core markets, strengthening its international presence, and investing in AWS's innovative cloud services to sustain long-term growth.\",\n",
    "    \"In 2023, foreign exchange rate fluctuations had a mixed impact on Amazon's financial performance. While these changes reduced consolidated net sales by $71 million, they positively influenced the International segment, increasing its net sales by $88 million. This highlights the nuanced effects of currency fluctuations, where gains in specific regions, such as the International segment, helped offset broader challenges at the consolidated level.\",\n",
    "    \"In 2022, AWS achieved a 29% year-over-year revenue growth, increasing from $62.2 billion in 2021 to $80.1 billion. Similarly, the Advertising segment experienced a 25% year-over-year growth, reaching $31 billion in revenue for the year. Together, these segments contributed significantly to Amazon's total consolidated revenue of $434 billion. AWS accounted for 19.59%, while Advertising contributed 7.14%, resulting in a cumulative contribution of approximately 26.73%.\",\n",
    "    \"In 2022, Amazon's substantial investments in technology infrastructure and fulfillment operations significantly impacted its cash flows and operating expenses. The company allocated $58.3 billion in cash capital expenditures to support AWS growth and expand its fulfillment network, resulting in a 31% increase in technology and content expenses due to higher payroll costs for technical teams and infrastructure spending on servers, networking equipment, and data centers. Fulfillment costs rose by 12%, driven by increased product sales volume, inventory levels, and wage rate incentives. These investments led to a decline in free cash flow to $(11,569) million, compared to $(9,069) million in 2021. Despite the higher costs, these expenditures were crucial for scaling operations, enhancing the customer experience, and sustaining long-term growth, particularly in AWS and global fulfillment capacity, highlighting Amazon’s commitment to maintaining its competitive edge in a rapidly evolving market.\",\n",

    "# question = \"How did Amazon's investments in technology infrastructure and fulfillment operations affect its cash flows and operating expenses in 2022?\"\n",
    "# ground_truth = \"In 2022, Amazon's substantial investments in technology infrastructure and fulfillment operations significantly impacted its cash flows and operating expenses. The company allocated $58.3 billion in cash capital expenditures to support AWS growth and expand its fulfillment network, resulting in a 31% increase in technology and content expenses due to higher payroll costs for technical teams and infrastructure spending on servers, networking equipment, and data centers. Fulfillment costs rose by 12%, driven by increased product sales volume, inventory levels, and wage rate incentives. These investments led to a decline in free cash flow to $(11,569) million, compared to $(9,069) million in 2021. Despite the higher costs, these expenditures were crucial for scaling operations, enhancing the customer experience, and sustaining long-term growth, particularly in AWS and global fulfillment capacity, highlighting Amazon’s commitment to maintaining its competitive edge in a rapidly evolving market.\"\n",

In 2019, Amazon's marketable securities portfolio included a variety of assets such as money market funds, equity securities, foreign government and agency securities, U.S. government and agency securities, corporate debt securities, asset-backed securities, and other fixed income securities. These marketable securities were categorized as either Level 1 or Level 2 securities on the balance sheet\"\n",
